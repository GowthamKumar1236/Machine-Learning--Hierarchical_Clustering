# Machine Learning - Hierarchical clustering 

Performed clustering analysis on the telecom data set.

The considered data set is a mixture of both categorical and numerical data. It consists of the number of customers who churn out.

Clustering algorithm was fitted to look for similarities or dissimilarities among data points so that similar ones can be grouped together.

The behaviour of the customers based on the groups would be very much helpful in modifying the existing plans to retain the existing customers, introducing new
plans that could attract new customers etc.
